Hi, I am a progrmmer.

Current active project is an implementation of a core of
[NEXO standards](https://www.nexo-standards.org/). It's a major evolving
specificaiton for payment's terminals. I have plans to release it as a
free (like in "freedom") and opensource software in the future. I have a
faint hope that maybe it will help to democratize payment industry and make
if more accessible for small players.

If your interested please contact me using an email from the profile.
