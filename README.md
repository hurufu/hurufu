Hi, I am a programmer.

Current (but not active) project is an implementation of a core of
[NEXO standards](https://www.nexo-standards.org/). It's a major evolving
specificaiton for payment terminals. I have plans to release it as a
free (like in "freedom") and opensource software in the future. I have a
faint hope that maybe it will help to democratize payment industry and make
if more accessible for small players.

[Live demo](http://139.162.175.251:5000/nexo).
(Isn't working, because I don't have time to update paths to python 3.10)

If your interested please contact me using an email from the profile.
