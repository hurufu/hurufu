Hi, I am a programmer.

Current (but not active) project is an implementation of a core of
[NEXO standards](https://www.nexo-standards.org/). It's a major evolving
specificaiton for payment terminals. I've released it as a
free (like in "freedom") and opensource software. 

[Live demo](http://139.162.175.251:5000/nexo).

If your interested please contact me using an email from the profile.
